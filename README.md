## Inspiration

#### Problems of Mental People Faced during Covid
COVID has accelerated the adoption of digital healthcare Services. Access to digital information and communication technologies are resulting in increased demand for services in remote health care management. 
In current scenario, mental health of COVID has accelerated the adoption of digital healthcare Services. Access to digital information and communication technologies are resulting in increased demand for services in remote health care management. 
In current scenario, mental health of people has suffered the most, and the medical system has not been able to keep up with the growing demand of mental help. 
Due to COVID, people are still fearing to schedule in-person appoints to consult doctor .
Also many problems like scheduling doctor appointments( unavailability of staff) , getting relevant info for personal healthcare and shyness to consult doctor for mental health. 

## What it does
To overcome the mentioned problems, we came up with a solution to develop a platform for people to schedule online appointments and organize therapy/ psychiatrist sessions.
The platform will use AI to analyze and summarize  the responses of patients during session to give doctor a summary of session and help them to give right advice to their patients.
Platform will also maintain reports of sessions and provide different options to patients to convey their problems/ routine to the doctor.
When a patient joins our platform a set of relevant questions will be asked to generate a report of patient and assign it to doctor who can then read and prepare for session. After the patient can schedule a video call session with doctor .Doctor can either Accept or ask for reschedule. 

In the session(video call) , using IBM speech to text and summarizer API, platform will generate real time summary of session and present it to doctor ,which he/she will use to give advice to patient. The advice will serve as outcome of session and will be accessible to patient and doctor at any time.
